##How to Run the Application
To run the application, clone the GitHub repository at https://github.com/jbuechs/Udacity-Project-6-Feed-Reader.git and open index.html

##About this Project
For this project, I was provided a website that reads RSS feeds. I had to create a series of tests using Jasmine to make sure the different features of the website were functional.

##What I learned
1. This was my first time doing any testing. I found writing Jasmine tests to be very straightforward.
2. I learned how to simulate clicking events to test their responses on the webpage.
3. I used the beforeEach function to test asynchronous events in the webpage.
